# Magento 2 config model generator
A simple generator for `Model/Config.php` file based on the provided `system.xml` contents.
The file can be used for easier access to the configuration values, provide value parsing, validation and type checks, etc.
Some people call that file a "configuration helper" but I prefer to call it configuration model since helpers are typically associated with
templates.

## Code structure
This project was build using Vite + TailwindCSS
